                <b>CubaOutings</b> was created about a year ago. Our idea is to show people from all over the world our country, which is constantly changing. That is why we are formed by a very carefully selected group of tour guides and drivers that have been working in the tourism business for years. The group is headed by Gloria Machado Leon who graduated from the University of Matanzas, nowadays working as a translator on Radio26 Redaction, the provincial Radio Station in Matanzas and Felix Michel Navarro who also graduated from the same university and has been working as a tour guide for  12 years.

                After this economic opening for Cuban private enterprises in 2010, you have the opportunity to know Cuba as a local. We give you the chance to create your own program, or just let us show you our country. Based on my experience as a tour guide for 12 years I have developed a group tours that cover the whole western part of Cuba. Havana would be our main course, but we will happy to show you any place you may desire to visit.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have achieved a great reputation for the service we provide. We have excellent young tour guides with a vast knowledge, either of the language or any other topic, such as history, politics, cigars, rum, coffee or anything that would be worth to know when you are not a local.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have comfortable and air conditioned cars of different sizes. We also give the possibility to go in classic cars, to feel like being back in the 50s. All this cars are certified by the State Insurance Company to guarantee security and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also wish to give you all the support you need when traveling. We offer transfers to any city or airport.  We can arrange your stay in private homes, that we highly recommend since you will have the opportunity to feel like a local family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, and above all, we will be here ready to give you a hand and organize any interesting or exciting activity that could feel your time in Cuba with pleasure.
